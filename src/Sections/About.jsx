        Who We are
      </h2>
      <p>
        I hold a Bachelor of Science (Honours), a Master of Science, and a
        Master of Teaching (Secondary Education), and I bring research
        experience to my academic and teaching practice. My approach combines
        subject expertise with an understanding of how students learn
        bestâ€”making complex biology concepts clear, relevant, and exam-ready.
